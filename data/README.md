# Data

This contains a short example of the Bible alignment data hosted at
https://github.com/Clear-Bible/Alignments . The intent there is to
create a central repository of Bible alignments to serve the Bible
translation community. See that repository for documentation of
formats and other details, and code for processing the data.

This contains a short excerpt of alignments from the Nestle-Aland Greek New
Testament, 27th edition[^1], and the Lexham English Bible (LEB)[^2],
for the first two chapters of Mark's Gospel. The directory structure
matches that used in https://github.com/Clear-Bible/Alignments for
consistency.
